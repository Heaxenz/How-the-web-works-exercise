Http means Hyper text transfer protocol, and is used to dictate how clients send or recieve data from a server.

url stands from uniform resource locators. They are used as addresses to specific internet resources.

DNS means domain name system. It is a system that takes readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.

A query string allows you to pass keys and values as pairs into the url.always after the path.

Get recieves data from a server (ex google)
& POST which sends data to a server. (ex publish on youtube,social media)

A HTTP request is a request from a client to a server that uses the hyper text transfer protocol.

A HTTP response is a response from a server using the the hyper text transfer. 

The HTTP header gives additional information about the server the client is reaching.
Examples: Request URL: http://google.com/, Request Method: GET , Status Code: 200.

First the url is turned into an IP address using DNS.
The browser makes a request to that IP address as a whole(includes headers)
The browser sends the response which is usually HTML.
It then makes a DOM from the resources in the response.
The browser makes separate HTTP request to the resources and receives response from a server for each.
